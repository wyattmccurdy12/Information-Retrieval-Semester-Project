2	Maybe these instructions will help you to get rid of that message Added instructions from the link  Alt F2  then type in gconf editor  Navigate to  apps gnome power manager notify low capacity and untick the value Or a single command gconftool   set  apps gnome power manager notify low capacity   type boolean false
10	You could use freenx instead of vnc  Freenx transmits x commands  with caching  instead of bitmaps 
12	Yes  X forwarding over ssh is a beautiful thing indeed  It allows you to use graphical applications on an app by app basis and have windows handled by your own desktop environment  You do not even need a desktop environment installed on the server You do need to set up some authentication things for it to work though  I believe you need xauth for that It s SO much faster than VNC as well  VNC was always rather laggy in my experience Edit I have no experience using this method via Windows  but I found this tutorial for you if you re interested 
18	You can use the alternative CD  instead of Ubuntu Desktop  Kubuntu Desktop  Server CD  which allows you to upgrade from CD 
19	I ve always helped identified people s needs and showed them how Ubuntu s implemented those needs  My audience is usually Mac and Windows people   but it s the same idea  Spend a few minutes touching on the new features in 10 04 then let the questions begin  I ve also found that spending a little time highlighting what you like and use it for is also helpful to show why you like use Ubuntu Try not to  as I ve made the mistake in the past  to be THIS IS   ALL OF YOUR ALTERNATIVES as it s usually frowned upon 
21	For 11 04 and earlier Are you installing it from the Ubuntu Software Center Go to Applications  Ubuntu Software Center Click on Canonical PartnersClick the Adobe Flash Plugin 11 and click install Note  this is the method I use on my 64 bit Ubuntu install and it has yet to fail me 
22	While inherently insecure  you could use XDMCP over a local network  I use it frequently to access virtual machines  Its just like logging on to your desktop  except you chose the remote server 
23	 opt is a viable option  Some people install it under  usr local 
26	Go to terminal  and enter sudo dpkg reconfigure unattended upgradesSay  yes  to the prompt  You ll still be notified about  normal  updates  such as those that contain bugfixes  but security updates will be installed automatically 
27	From a terminal sudo apt get remove xfce4
30	System    Administration    Software Sources    Updates  tab     Check for updates   Daily   Every two days   Weekly   Every two weeks 
31	For 10 10 and earlier versions  and 11 04  in an Ubuntu Classic session Open Update Manager  System   Administration   Update Manager  On the Updates tab  there s a drop down box for  Check for updates    with options for Daily  every two days  weekly or every two weeks Or you can turn it off and just check manually whenever you want 
35	You can do this easily for security updates From System Settings open Update Manager  Click the  Settings     button  then on the  Updates  tab  select the radio button  Install security updates without confirmation  To automatically install all updates  see the answer below 
39	No  You should never just edit sources list  Use the update manager  or if you use command line  use do release upgrade  You can upgrade safely from LTS editions to other LTS editions  or otherwise  you need to step via each release  Only those pathways are supported  and prevent some issues that can otherwise occur with improper upgrades 
40	I believe you can upgrade directly from LTS to LTS  see e g  https   help ubuntu com community LucidUpgrades
43	On commandline the simplest way is probably to use tasksel sudo tasksel install lamp server
44	It s possible to do it the other way around  but I ve never seen anyone who was able to do this simply by installing a metapackage or something Your best bet is either a clean installmanually removing unneeded packages and installing the server components you need
45	sudo apt get updatesudo apt get install taskselsudo tasksel install lamp serverIt will install all the basic LAMP stack for you  prompt for MySQL root password  etc More specifically it will install the following packages  and their dependencies mysql client core 5 1 libwrap0 apache2  libaprutil1 dbd sqlite3 tcpd  libapache2 mod php5 apache2 2 common  apache2 utils php5 common  libaprutil1 ldap libaprutil1  php5 mysql mysql server core 5 1  libdbi perl libplrpc perl mysql server  apache2 2 bin libdbd mysql perl  libhtml template perl  libnet daemon perl libapr1  mysql server 5 1 libmysqlclient16  ssl cert apache2 mpm prefork  mysql common mysql client 5 1  You might also want to take a peek at the Ubuntu Server Guide 
48	I use x11vnc  which works very well for me  It lets you keep a persistent graphical session between connections  so you can disconnect and reconnect and everything will be just the way you left it  It also supports tunneling over SSH  See these Ubuntu community docs for a short description and some instructions on setting it up 
52	I don t think it s currently possible to do so via the GUI  but the following should work  albeit be a little kludgy  YMMV  Add the following line to  etc sudoers  use sudo visudo to edit the file   packageinstallers ALL   NOPASSWD   usr bin software center  usr bin apt getThen you just need to create and add the specific users to the packageinstallers group   sudo addgroup packageinstallers  sudo adduser jdoe packageinstallersNow jdoe can do the following   sudo apt get install and you can edit the desktop menu item for the Software Center so that it call on software center prepending the command with gksudo  PolicyKit may allow you to do so without sudo  but it s beyond my understanding at this point  
54	There s a nice article on the topic written by the Ubuntu developer himself  please see  http   www linux mag com id 7568 1 Summary A combination of LUKS and dm crypt are used for whole disk encryption in Linux Ubuntu uses the Enterprise Cryptographic File System  ECryptfs  from version    9 10 to enable home drive encryption on login An upper and lower directory are created  where the upper directory is stored unencrypted in RAM  granting access to the system and current user  The lower directory is passed atomic  encrypted units of data and stored in physical memory File and directory names use a single  mount wide fnek  file name encryption key   The header of each encrypted file contains an fek  file encryption key   wrapped with a separate  mount wide fekek  file encryption key  encryption key   The Linux kernel keyring manages keys and provides encryption via its common ciphers Using an eCryptfs PAM  Pluggable Authentication Module  does not break unattended reboots  unlike typical full disk encryption solutions The eCryptfs layered filesystem enables per file  incremental  encrypted backups 
55	Press Alt F2  type gnome session save   logout  then hit enter  If an application is blocking logout  try gnome session save   force logout
57	The duration of the notification is  I believe  dependent on the length of the message From the perspective of someone who was worked with it indirectly  by using the pynotify module in Python   I have discovered that specifying a duration for a message is not possible 
59	You can just switch back the display manager to use kdm using sudo dpkg reconfigure gdmand then selecting kdm 
60	Run rm  r    gconf apps panel in a terminal  then log out of Gnome and log back in 
62	SimplyEncrypting your home folder doesn t actually make your computer more secure   it simply makes all the files and folders in your home folder more secure from unauthorized viewing Your computer is still  vulnerable  in a security standpoint   but it becomes very difficult for your content to be stolen  unless the attacker has your password  You won t need to actually enter your password any more than you normally do   when you log in to your computer your files are seamlessly decrypted for just your session There is a possibility  depending on your computers hardware  that this will affect the performance on your machine  If you re worried about performance more than security  and you re on an older machine  you may wish to disable this feature TechnicallyUbuntu uses  eCryptfs  which stores all the data in a directory  this case the home folders  as encrypted data  When a user is logged in that encrypted folder is mounted with second decryption mount  this is a temporary mount that works similar to tmpfs   it s created and run in RAM so the files are never stored in a decrypted state on the HD   The idea is   if your hard drive is stolen and the contents read those items aren t able to be read since Linux needs to be running with your authentication to create the successful mount and decryption   The keys are SHA 512 encrypted data based of several user aspects   the keys are then stored in your encrypted key ring    The end result is technically secure data  as long as your password isn t cracked or leaked  You will not have to enter your password any more than usual  There is a slight increase of Disk I O and CPU which  depending on your computer specs  may hinder performance   though it s quite seamless on most modern PCs
63	Move the old configuration directory out of the way  and it ll get reset  Of course  to take effect  you ll have to restart the panel mv    gconf apps panel   gnome panel backupgnome panel   replace  
64	Add it to the Ubuntu Artwork pool  here  http   www flickr com groups ubuntu artwork A team of judges will select somewhere around 15 photos from this pool for the default wallpapers 
65	Open the  Ubuntu Software Center   under the Applications menu    Search for  indicator me  and remove it   Log out and back in to see the change This will remove it for all users on your system   I don t believe there s a way to merely hide it for yourself 
68	As far as I know  there is no performance lost as far as overhead and whatnot  It mostly depends on what you have installed  You can turn desktop Ubuntu into server Ubuntu by installing the same security monitoring visualization programs  The server edition just comes with a better set of pre installed packages suited to a secure  easily maintained server Either way  I would recommend NOT installing X server and a desktop environment  GNOME  KDE  etc   This reduces boot time and memory CPU usage 
70	If you enable Ctrl Alt Del  you can use that to kill the X server  which will log you out  To enable this  go to System    Preferences    Keyboard  then go to the Layouts tab and click Options  Expand the  Key sequence to kill X server  and check the box 
71	While I haven t  that is one thing that gets heavily tested in LTS releases prior to their release 
73	You must have somehow installed the new  under development Ubuntu clock  Go into Synaptic  and remove the package indicator datetime  That should fix it 
74	Reconfigure exim4 sudo dpkg reconfigure exim4One of the questions it ll ask you is for the  System mail name   You want to change that  
75	I have tested this myself on a VM  And as Andrew said  this was heavily tested before the release 
77	You can do an installation of a newer version of Ubuntu over top of an existing installation   You ll lose all of your  non local  1   system files and applications  but it will preserve everything in  home Select the advanced partitioning option from the menu of either the desktop CD installer or the alternate CD installer   Set the mountpoint of your existing root partition to   and make sure the format box is not checked   Repeat these steps for your home partition  if you have one 1  Where local system directories would be  usr src   usr local  and  var local
78	The significant performance factor in Ubuntu Desktop is the inclusion of Gnome  Ubuntu Desktop is fine for a server  although a more lightweight desktop environment may be desired   but if you do not need a graphical environment  Ubuntu Server would be preferable This is not strictly performance related  but Ubuntu Desktop also contains several packages which would simply not be useful in a server environment  such as OpenOffice and GIMP  These can always be removed however 
79	The Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard that is part of the Linux Standard Base recommends to use  opt  I have only had good experience with that  Many commercial packages go into opt as well and stay to their own folder in there  
81	I personally prefer apt get because it s a command line program  And the syntax for installing packages is very simple sudo apt get install packagenameI use apt get on a day to day basis for installing and removing packages Synaptic is GUI based and aptitude is text based 
84	Gmail Notifier is probably the best option for what you are trying to accomplish 
85	If you don t have any confidential data in those files  you could use Dropbox to keep them automatically in sync across multiple machines  The Dropbox daemon will synchronize one folder  usually   Dropbox  but you can include other files or directories in the synchronization by symlinking them into that folder   I think Dropbox may also offer some other method to keep multiple folders in sync  but I can t find the directions right now 
87	The Debian FAQ has a pretty good explanation of the different package managers   dpkg  apt get  aptitude  tasksel  synaptic 
88	You can use my ppa  that I have created for this purpose  Please take notice of the pinning that is necessary  Also  aptitude will not recognize the pinning  You must use the aptitude specific method if you want to use it Note   this is for 10 04  lucid  only
89	You can t do this normally  However  there is a patched version of notify osd that supports it From Ubuntu 16 04 onwards You ll need to add two PPA s sudo add apt repository ppa leolik leoliksudo add apt repository ppa nilarimogard webupd8sudo apt updateThen install it like this sudo apt get upgradesudo apt get install notifyosdconfigThe configuration dialog should be in Applications  Accessories or notifyosdconf from the terminal  There s a setting for the standard notification duration as per screenshot above if you don t set it the   expire time parameter Example notify send   urgency LOW   expire time 1   icon face laugh  test   1 second Older versions   9 10 14 10 You ll need to add two PPA s sudo add apt repository ppa leolik leoliksudo add apt repository ppa amandeepgrewal notifyosdconfigsudo apt get updateThen install it like this sudo apt get upgradesudo apt get install notifyosdconfigThe configuration dialog should be in Applications  Accessories or notifyosdconf from the terminal  There s a setting for notification duration as per screenshot above Example notify send   urgency LOW   expire time 1   icon face laugh  test   1 second 
91	Xming and XDMCP is a brillant option Edit Xming is a x server for windows  which is based on Cygwin and has the ability to share the clipboard and implements different desktop layouts as well XDMCP is a simple and   important   unencrypted protocol  don t use it over the internet  to connect a X displaymanager and a x server 
92	I ve had good luck with CheckGmail  Has a nice GUI  cool toaster popups  and allows you take actions on emails from the tray  sudo apt get install checkgmail  checkgmail  
98	Psyke83 s on the Ubuntu Forums wrote a  script  to do this for PulseAudio  Ubuntu 10 10 Currently the easiest method is to install from a deb created by WebUp8 Ubuntu 10 04 and below There is a PPA containing the equalizer sudo add apt repository ppa psyke83 ppasudo apt get update    sudo apt get install pulseaudio equalizer
101	I made a separate profile for Vim which uses a solid  opaque color in the background  I just manually switch to it whenever I use Vim  Not sure whether or not there s a better method  I d like to think so 
103	Each file has rights for three different categories the owner of the file the group associated with the file  andeverybody else Rights mean the right to read the file  the right to write to the file  or the right to execute the file in case of a script or program On the CLI  you maychange the owner with chown  e g  chown guillermooochange the group with chgrp  e g  chgrp rootchange the rights with chmod  e g  chmod u w filename ext  Adds writing permission for the owner of the file filename ext If you d like to know more about each of these tools  open a terminal and type man  tool   e g  man chmod 
104	Yeshttps   launchpad net ubuntu  source haskell platform
105	Yes  it s already packaged and released in maverick  the development branch of Ubuntu     rmadison haskell platformhaskell platform   2010 1 0 0 1   maverick universe   source  all
106	If you re using Ubuntu Packages run sudo apt get purge So that should be something like sudo apt get purge ruby rubygemsFrom the apt get man page   purge      purge is identical to remove except that packages are removed and purged  any configuration files are deleted too  
107	Remove all but the current release of Ubuntu you re running from  etc apt sources list  Then sudo apt get update  sudo apt get dist upgrade  Let me know if you still have trouble  You may have to reinstall  
109	Without upgrading  You may need to setup a Virtual instance of Lucid or Maverick or install that specific version under a new partition on your machine  I find that VirtualBox works well  and is free  for Ubuntu 
110	Three routes Install Ubuntu in a VM  Pros  Your installation is persistent  and you can switch back and forth between the VM and your normal desktop with ease Cons  It ll be slow  Use a LiveCD  Pros  Most straightforward  same method as when you first installed Ubuntu  Cons  No persistence of session  your environment is lost when you restart  Install on a separate machine  CD read times are sloooow  Pros  Persistence  speed  Cons  Expensive if you don t have the hardware  Personally  I d go the VM route  You ll need to do with a LiveCD or physical install if your bug involves the hardware 
113	I depends on what kind of bug it was  estethic  a program crash  etc  but the simplest way would be to download Lucid s live cd  boot it and see if you can reproduce the bug  If it s something that requires a real installation and it s not enough booting a live cd  then install Lucid on a virtual machine using VirtualBox  and you can test almost anything in there without affecting your current environment 
114	For testing Maverick  testdrive is easiest  It ll automatically download the latest Maverick daily and run it in a Virtual Machine sudo apt get install testdrive virtualbox osetestdrive
115	Try Firewall Builder sudo apt get install fwbuilder
117	Firestarter has always worked well in my opinion  It supports a robust GUI and supports all options of iptables  sudo apt get install firestarter
118	I ve never taken time to understand iptables  but I believe gufw does the job  Even I was able to set up a firewall within a couple of minutes 
119	Installing new themes in Ubuntu 10 10 and belowTo install the themes open the Theme Manager which can be accessed from System   Preferences   Appearances then just drag the theme icons etc on to the window Once installed you can either directly use the theme or modify it to use individual components like icons  borders  etc in the Theme Manager 
121	In Ubuntu 11 04 and earlier System   Preferences   AppearanceThen click  Get more themes online  which points to  http   art gnome org themesUbuntu 11 10 has a simplified Appearances preference that dosen t include a button for getting more themes 
122	I believe you need to change the options from auto to noauto
126	GNOME Terminal supports 256 colors  but doesn t advertise its support   You can override vim s autodetection by putting the following if  COLORTERM     gnome terminal   set t Co 256endifin your    vimrc Note  if you use GNU screen  it will happily eat those 256 color codes and convert them to basic 16 colors   A better fix is to change TERM to xterm 256color before launching screen vim Update for 2017  if you have a sufficiently recent Vim  7 4 1799 or newer   and a sufficiently advanced terminal emulator  xterm  or gnome terminal based on a sufficiently recent version of VTE   you can  set termguicolors and terminal vim will use full 24 bit colors as defined by your vim theme using highlight guifg  rrggbb guibg  rrggbb 
129	Probably the most popular package managers are apt get  aptitude  synaptic  and Software Center  There are others  Linux Mint has its own  and there are some designed for KDE   but these are the ones you ll run into most often apt get is a simple command line tool  It s handy if you know the exact package name of what you want to install and don t want to spend time clicking through a GUI to get it aptitude is very similar to apt get  and I ve heard that it deals better with crazy dependency situations  Which one is really better is debatable synaptic is a low level GUI  This is a good choice if you are a fairly advanced user but are not comfortable with command line utilities Software Center is a very high level  new user friendly GUI  Software is nicely categorized so that  if you re not exactly sure what app you want  you can find what you need quickly   The Software Center also stands out in that it is the only package manager in this list that allows you to purchase commercial applications dpkg is a lesser used  low level package manager standard for most Debian based systems   In reality  apt get  aptitude  synaptic  and the Ubuntu Software Center are all just front ends to either dpkg or apt  which is in itself a front end to dpkg In answer to your question   which one is the recommended choice for normal day to day package management   I would say that Software Center is recommended for most uses  But as you gain more experience  you will find some of the features of lower level package managers useful 
130	The way we run our Ubuntu Hour is basically one of a very relaxed social interaction  No one needs to talk about Ubuntu if they don t want to and we generally let the flow of the hour or two take us to random places Basically we just enjoy each others company It s important to not put too much of a burden or expectation  those kinds of more targeted events should be saved for specific things  like the Ubuntu Workshops etc Oh and make sure you pick a location that members can get to 
132	You can reset the panel by runninggconftool 2   recursive unset  apps panelin a Terminal or by hitting Alt F2 and pasting this command in the textfield and then hit run  After that gnome panel needs a restart and therefore it has to be killed with the commandpkill gnome panelthe same way as the command before  The reset gnome panel will start again automatically 
133	There is an ongoing QA effort for Laptops and Desktops in the Ubuntu Community   you can find that information here Old Ubuntu Laptop Reports and for everything 11 04 and onwards  Laptop Testing SiteYou can find the reports for Lucid tested Laptops tests here  10 04 Lucid Laptop Tests  The best course of action is to find a handful of laptops you re interested in then check the Reports on each If you feel compelled to help you can find more information at the Laptop Testing page Finally there is a detailed list of compatible systems on the Ubuntu Certification page 
135	If you get a computer with Ubuntu preinstalled  it s guaranteed to work with Ubuntu  Dell and System76 are the two most recommended companies from which to get Ubuntu computers 
136	There is a wiki page of supported hardware  but I don t think it s fully exhaustive  The motherboard I m using works fine and doesn t appear anywhere on that list 
137	This is probably an alsa issue  I had the same problem  but it got reported as a bug and fixed  link to bug report
139	It sounds like Empathy may need a patch to do this kind of thing internally  But you should be able to poke Empathy to do the right thing by disconnecting from your network and reconnect I ve seemingly had bugs with Empathy refusing the connect to a bunch of networks at various times  But it should give a count down  Will retry in X seconds  But that will take code and if you want it  a bug report needs to be made 
140	For 11 04 and previous versionsThere s a program for creating wallpaper slideshows called CREBS  Check out this article about it  http   www omgubuntu co uk 2010 05 crebs the ultimate wallpaper slideshow applicationA simpler app that has fewer features but is easier to use can be found here  http   gnome look org content show php Wallpaper Slideshow content 125178
141	Usually automated testing is done on a per project basis and the quality of those tests are highly dependant on the project s organisation and quality control  Tests can be tied into the building of debs and such but as far as I know I ve never heard of any external testing framework outside of any particular project 
144	Yes  try Pinta  Pinta is a drawing editing program modeled after Paint NET  It s goal is to provide a simplified alternative to GIMP for casual users  It is currently early in development HomepagePPA 
146	Another retailer for preinstalled Ubuntu systems is ZaReason 
147	You might also want to check out Krita or for plain photo editing digikam with its plugins Both are packaged in Ubuntu  Also for kids related drawing tuxpaint is great 
148	There s Pinta as David points out  which clones the user interface and took the same open sourced code to implement image adjustements and effects  There are other lightweight alternatives that might fit the bill if you don t require features such as layers or filters  Gnome Paint and KolourPaint for KDE  The Gnome Paint site hosts a DEB file  so you can download that and double click to install  To install KolourPaint sudo apt get install kolourpaint4Or search for it on the Software Center  Note that if you don t currently have any other KDE app  then installing KolourPaint will also install other KDE specific libraries that will take a considerable amout of disk space  That being said  I found KolourPaint more feature complete than Gnome Paint 
149	Are you looking for something like TuxPaint 
153	You could always remove all packages  making a few exceptions for apt get  etc  Then run sudo apt get install ubuntu desktopThis installs the desktop metapackage which has pretty much every other package as a dependency 
155	Update  Gedit has now added this feature  I m keeping my answer around for those using older versions of the application Gedit does not come with this feature But there is a plugin you can get Splitview plugin  Archived page from Gedit Plugins   GNOME Live Splitview plugin source code  Archived page 
157	Also after you remove xfce and all other apps  reinstall ubuntu desktop to make sure you get everything back
159	Well Ubuntu is working on multitouch and it should be in either the next release or the release after  Synaptics is making it too but I dont know if thats ready yet  The touch screens will work it will just move the mouse to the place you touch it just wont do anything special 
160	Try Touchbook 
162	A project does exist at https   wiki ubuntu com Testing Automation for this   I m not sure how much it currently covers  but there is also automated upgrade testing done to test out upgrading various package combinations 
163	It is possible to use karmic packages and pin them with aptitude  This can be done by using this commands   remove all php packgesudo aptitude purge  dpkg  l   grep php  awk   print  2    tr   n        use karmiс for php pakage  pin params   a  archive   c  components   v  version   o  origin  and l  label  echo  e  Package  php5 nPin  release a karmic nPin Priority  991 n     sudo tee    etc apt preferences d php    dev nullapt cache search php5  grep php5  awk   print  Package     1   nPin  release   a karmic nPin Priority  991 n    sudo tee  a  etc apt preferences d php    dev nullapt cache search  n libapache2 mod php5  awk   print  Package     1   nPin  release a karmic nPin Priority  991 n     sudo tee  a  etc apt preferences d php    dev nullecho  e  Package  php pear nPin  release a karmic nPin Priority  991 n     sudo tee  a      etc apt preferences d php    dev null  add karmic to source listgrep  main restricted   etc apt sources list grep  v      sed s lucid karmic g   sudo tee              etc apt sources list d karmic list    dev null  update package database  use apt get if aptitude crash sudo apt get update  install phpsudo aptitude install  t karmic php5 cli php5 cgi  or  and  sudo apt get install  t karmic  libapache2 mod php5sudo aptitude hold  dpkg  l   grep php5  awk   print  2    tr   n       doneGot this from link text
166	The  etc motd file gets its information about whether a reboot is required from  var run reboot required file You can check the content of this file in terminal by using cat  etc motd command
168	https   wiki ubuntu com UbuntuDevelopment NewPackages details the normal process for including packages into Ubuntu There are often a lot of packages awaiting review on the REVU site  which is a reason why we suggest that packages are uploaded to Debian  where they can benefit even more people https   wiki ubuntu com Debian ForUbuntuDevelopers Getting new software in Debian explains how this can be done For Ubuntu  you can ask people for reviews on  ubuntu motu on irc ubuntu com  and for Debian there is a  debian mentors channel on irc oftc net Alternatively  there is a developer ubuntu com page which details a separate process of getting applications reviewed   published for stable releases  
169	Normally if the file  var run reboot required exists you should reboot  You can see if this file is there by using this simple command in gnome terminal ls  var run reboot required
170	Well  first I would suggest that you put the source into a Launchpad repository Then you can put the package in your PPA and distribute it As for getting it included in the official repository    it really depends on the app Per duanedesign s comment  this page can help get you started and this page can help with some common upload errors  
171	You can simply check if the file  var run reboot required exists or not For example  any of these would tell you  no such file  or  file not found  if you do not need to reboot  otherwise  if you need to reboot  the file would exist and these commands would show information about the file file  var run reboot requiredstat  var run reboot requiredls  var run reboot requiredIn a bash script  you can use    bin bashif    f  var run reboot required    then  echo  reboot required fi
172	While I d recommend Dropbox  a better cross platform solution  if all your workstations are Ubuntu based you could use Ubuntu One  If you re looking for something more powerful have a look at rsync 
173	It is not a real gnome applet per se   but you can use gnubiff  it sits near the clock  in the notification indicator applet   gnubiff checks for mail within a file   a qmail or MH style dir   or an IMAP4  or POP3 or APOP server   It can  display headers  number   sender   subject  and date  when new mail has  arrived   While gnubiff is  implemented as a GNOME panel applet   it also runs as an  independent icon  on the desktop in other environments 
176	These are the minimum requirements  for a one machine setup  for setting up an Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud Machine  at least 1  though 2 or 3 is highly recommended  to separate controllers and nodes CPU   2Ghz  dual core recommended Memory   2Gb ramDisk Space  100GbNote that with those minimum specs  this will still be SLOW You can find a quick tutorial located at  http   www ubuntu com cloud private deployAs well  there is a complete community guide at https   help ubuntu com community UEC
178	You could create a shared Git repository on a private server with SSH access  For example  I am using a nearlyfreespeech net account for this  and cost is very low  If you want to get fancy you can create a cron script to automatically push pull changes every so often  always keeping your files up to date  As long as you don t work on two machines simultaneously  then you should never encounter any merge conflicts 
179	You can do an installation of Ubuntu over top of an existing installation  You ll lose all of your  non local  1   system files and applications  but it will preserve everything in  home Select the advanced partitioning option from the menu of either the desktop CD installer or the alternate CD installer  Set the mountpoint of your existing root partition to   and make sure the format box is not checked  Repeat these steps for your home partition  if you have one 1  Where local system directories would be  usr src   usr local  and  var local 
183	Yes  I upgraded a production system  and worked fine 
184	growisofs  speed 2  dvd compat  Z  dev dvdrw dvd image isoReplace  dev dvdrw with your dvd writer path and dvd image iso with the iso filenameIf you do not have growisofs installed you will need to install the dvd rw tools package with the following commandsudo apt get install dvd rw tools
186	You can check that you have enough TTY s Open a terminal and do grep tty  etc default console setupIt should show  check the last number  it should say 6  ACTIVE CONSOLES   dev tty 1 6  If not  edit the  etc default console setup file by typing gksudo gedit  etc default console setupAnd look for ACTIVE CONSOLES  and make the line look this ACTIVE CONSOLES   dev tty 1 6  
187	The F  license appears to be non free as it only allows non commercial use  so it wouldn t be legal to distribute this in a PPA  At best  there could be an fsharp installer package created  which would automate those steps of downloading   installing it
