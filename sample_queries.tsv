6	How to graphically interface with a headless server 	server ssh security remote-desktop vnc	How to graphically interface with a headless server  I have a ubuntu development server at work  It is an old rack server that is located somewhere in the company s dungeon  where nobody ever goes  The only way it can work is as a so called headless server  i e  with no monitor keyboard connected and only accepting network connections  Obviously  if you just need terminal access ssh is more than enough  I  however  would also like to connect to the graphical interface from time to time  At the moment I am using the built in VNC functionality but I am pretty sure this is neither the most efficient nor the most secure way of approaching this issue I have done a bit of research on the issue but failed to come to any definite conclusions  I read about trying to forward the X environment over ssh  which would at least solve my security concerns  Can anyone share their experiences in setting this up  Is there any other way that might be worth looking at I almost exclusively connect to this server from a Windows machine  I don t know if that might be a problem for some of the methods suggested  server ssh security remote-desktop vnc

running Ubuntu 20 04 happily  and then over the weekend decided to back everything up and install 22 04   I ve had a couple of teething issues which I ve solver  however I m having real issues with SSH   I have two first generation WD MyCloud drives which handle all my backups and files both on and away from home   I can still connect to the shares with no problems  however I need to SSH onto both drives in order to run maintenance  backup between cloud drives  etc Initially I couldn t gain SSH access at all after upgrading  however the one fix at this website worked   I can now connect via SSH and entering a password However with Ubuntu 20 04 I had set up a passphrase so that various autyomated scripts that I use using rsync could copy between cloud drives and also between Ubuntu and the cloud drive shares   This was working until I upgraded  now the scripts continually ask me for my password and I can t figure out how to stop it What I was originally doing was runningssh keygen  b 4096to generate a passphrase and thenssh copy id root serverto copy the passphrase acrossIf I then enteredssh root serverit simply connected without asking to my password I know this is going to be due to my cloud drives only supporting the now insecure SSH  but I cannot upgrade it to a more secure one  unless someone knows how   I would prefer to do this to be honest    My maintenance scripts can make up to 20 connections over a period of hours  and to have to sit and constantly enter the password is becoming a pain Can anyone help me get my remote rsync commands working again so they don t keep asking me for my passwordThe terminal outputs as I run through these arecolin colin desktop    ssh  ssh keygen  b 4096Generating public private rsa key pair Enter file

However if I clear the keys on the server out  reinstall 22 04 and do the same  it still prompts me for the password   I ve updated my question to show the output of the commands as they are being run
